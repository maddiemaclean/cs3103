    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <h4>Early Life</h4>
    <p>Charles Babbage was born in 1791 in London where he studied at Trinty College in Cambridge, where he developed a 
        passion for math and science. He was interested in solving complex problems, especially inaccurarices in mathematical tables.
        This started his lifelong pursuit of mechanical computing.
    </p>

    <h4>Career</h4>
    <p>Babbage is best known for designing the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine, devices which were designed 
        to automate mathematical calucations. Nether machine was constructed during his life, however they introduced core 
        concepts such as programmability, conditional logic and memory storage which laid the foundation for modern computing.
        He collaborated with Ada Lovelace, who wrote detailed notes on the Analytical Engine, which cemented his legacy.
    </p>

    <h4>Furter Work</h4>
    <p>Babbage made significant contributions to economics, cryptography and industrial efficiency. He was a founding member of the 
        British Association for the Advancement of Science and authored many works, including On the Econmony of Machinery and Manufactures.
        Babbage was underappreciated during his life, but his ideas have left a legacy; recognizing him as a pioneer of techinal innovation.

    <h3>Notable Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Babbage designed the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator which automates polynomial calcuations</li>
        <li>Babbage conceptualized the Analytical Engine, a advanced mechanical computer able to perform any mathematical
         calucation. It featured elements of modern computers such as the ALU, Control Flow and Memory Storage.</li>
        <li>Babbage was founding member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1831.</li>
        <li>Babbage introduced basic concepts such as programmability and the separation of processing and storage</li>
